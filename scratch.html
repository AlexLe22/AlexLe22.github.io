    <h1>Street Fighter 3: Scratch Edition</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A one on one fighting game</p>
    <h2>Describe some programming concepts or structures you learned in this unit that you applied in your game.
</h2>
<p>I learned about the use of conditionals and variables when making the game.  Conditionals made up 90% of my game, since practically everything needed a cause and effect.  I implemented variables into conditionals and mainly used them to identify what moves will be used when a key is pressed.</p>
<h2>Did you encounter any problems or struggles while working on this project? If you did, how did you solve or overcome them?</h2>
<p>Because of my games complexity, I've encountered numerous bugs and tried to remedy them by looking at my code again and trying to identify a problem.</p>
<h2>What aspects of your game do you like best?</h2>
<p>When my game works properly, I like the animations I implemented into the characters and their actions.</p>
<h2>If more time was given for you to work on your game, what would you improve or modify about your game?
</h2>
<p>I would definately iron out the game's bugs and add more moves.</p>
